Since i was trying to create an Electron project with React.js, i faced a lot of problems. There's an official  [boilerplate](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate), but it's too vague, hard to understand and has a lot of features that you probably don't need. So i decided to build this template from scratch, [using this guide as a reference](https://www.codementor.io/@randyfindley/how-to-build-an-electron-app-using-create-react-app-and-electron-builder-ss1k0sfer).

This projects uses [Material - UI](https://material-ui.com/)


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn electron-dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />

### `yarn electron-pack"`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br />
Be careful to change -w parameters in the composer.json file.

## Aditional Notes

I'll be working on this, in order to add redux, react router and other features. 

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
